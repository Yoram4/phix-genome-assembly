# PhiX Genome Assembly Using Overlap Graphs

A computational biology project for assembling the PhiX genome using overlap graph algorithms. This implementation simulates NGS reads with varying error rates, constructs overlap graphs, and evaluates assembly performance under different parameter conditions.

## Features
- Generation of error-free and error-prone genome reads with customizable parameters
- Overlap graph construction and traversal for genome assembly
- Performance evaluation with various quality metrics
- Experimentation framework for parameter optimization (N, l, p)

## Implementation
This project is part of the Algorithms in Computational Biology course (236522) and demonstrates practical applications of graph-based algorithms in genomic data assembly.
